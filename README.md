🪙 **Gullak** — Smart FinTech Learning Platform for Kids & Teens
💡 Learn. Play. Grow.

Gullak is an interactive FinTech learning platform that makes financial education simple, visual, and fun for young minds.
It divides learners into three themed worlds — each designed for a specific age group — to help them explore money, savings, and finance through stories, games, and interactive learning.

🎯 Project Overview

Financial literacy is a crucial life skill, but it’s often taught too late.
